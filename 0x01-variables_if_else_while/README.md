## Project Description

In this project, you will learn about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. You will also practice declaring and defining variables of type char, int, and unsigned int, using if and if...else statements, and implementing while loops.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to navigate to the project's directory. For example, to access the "variables_if_else_while" project, you would run:

bash cd 0x01-variables_if_else_while


To compile and run a C file in the project, you can use the gcc compiler. For example, to compile and run a file named `main.c`, you would run:

bash gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c -o main ./main


## Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**: Write a C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line. The program should store a different random number every time it is run.

2. **The last digit**: Write a C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line. The program should store a different value every time it is run.

3. **How to use the while loop**: The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a certain condition is true. Here is an example of using a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

4. **How to use variables with the while loop**: To use variables with the while loop in C, you need to declare the variable before the loop and update it inside the loop. Here's an example.
