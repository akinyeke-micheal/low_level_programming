Introduction
This repository is part of the curriculum at ALX, a software engineering school. It contains a collection of introductory and advanced programs in C, covering a wide range of topics in low-level programming 1.

Projects
Each project is contained within its own directory and contains a set of tasks or exercises to complete. The projects build on one another, with later projects exploring more advanced concepts and techniques. Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

0x00-hello_world: Contains introductory programs that demonstrate how to output text to the console or terminal.
0x01-variables_if_else_while: Covers the basics of variables and control flow statements, such as if-else statements and loops.
0x02-functions_nested_loops: Covers the basics of writing and calling functions, as well as more advanced looping techniques like nested loops.
0x03-debugging: Focuses on techniques for finding and fixing errors in code.
0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: Builds on the concepts covered in 0x02, with more advanced functions and nested loops.
0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: Covers the basics of pointers, arrays, and strings in C.
0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: Continues the exploration of pointers, arrays, and strings, with a focus on more advanced concepts and techniques.
0x07-pointers_arrays_strings: Further expands on pointers, arrays, and strings, with a focus on dynamic memory allocation and other advanced topics.
0x08-recursion: Covers the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
0x09-static_libraries: Covers the creation and use of static libraries in C.
0x0A-argc_argv: Covers the use of command-line arguments in C programs.
0x0B-malloc_free: Covers dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using the malloc and free functions.
0x0C-more_malloc_free: Continues the exploration of dynamic memory allocation, with a focus on more advanced techniques and concepts.
0x0D-preprocessor: Covers the role of the C preprocessor in modifying code before compilation.
0x0E-structures_typedef: Covers the use of structures and typedefs in C.
0x0F-function_pointers: Covers the use of function pointers, which allow functions to be treated as data.
0x10-variadic_functions: Covers the use of variadic functions, which take a variable number of arguments.
0x12-singly_linked_lists: Covers the concept of singly linked lists, a basic data structure in computer science.
0x13-more_singly_linked_lists: Continues the exploration of singly linked lists, with a focus on more advanced techniques and concepts.
0x14-bit_manipulation: Covers the manipulation of individual bits within binary data.
0x15-file_io: Covers file input/output in C, including reading from and writing to files 1.
Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/akinyeke-micheal/alx-low_level_programming

Then, navigate to the cloned repository:

cd alx-low_level_programming
To access a specific project, navigate to the project's directory. For example, to access the "Hello, World" project, you would run:

cd 0x00-hello_world
To compile and run a C file in the project, you can use the gcc compiler. For example, to compile and run a file named main.c, you would run:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c -o main
./main
