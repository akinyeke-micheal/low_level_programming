## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to reinforce your understanding of functions and introduce the concept of nested loops. Through practical exercises, you will enhance your ability to structure code using functions and efficiently implement complex looping patterns.

## Key Concepts

### Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. They promote code modularity and improve readability. In this project, you will create, call, and manage functions to accomplish various programming tasks.

### Nested Loops

Nested loops involve using one or more loops inside another loop. This allows you to create intricate patterns and iterate over multidimensional data structures. Understanding how to use nested loops is crucial for solving problems that require iterating through multiple levels of data.

## Functions

Describe any specific guidelines or conventions related to function implementation. Highlight the importance of function names, parameters, and return values.

## Nested Loops

Explain the principles of using nested loops, including proper indentation and the order of iteration. Provide examples of scenarios where nested loops are particularly useful.

## How to Use

Include instructions on how to compile and run the code for this project. If specific dependencies or configurations are required, outline them here.

## Examples

Provide illustrative examples of functions and nested loops. These examples should cover a range of scenarios and showcase best practices in code organization.

```c
// Example of a simple function
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main() {
    // Function call
    greet();
    return 0;
}
c
Copy code
// Example of nested loops
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Nested loop to print a pattern
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
